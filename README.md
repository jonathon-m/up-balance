# up-balance
An SMS notifier for Up Bank transactions

## Why?
While attempting to use a non-smart phone, I realised it would be hard to keep track of my bank balance on the go. 
So I built this in an afternoon, hooking Up Bank's webhooks into SNS, which sends me a text. 

## Requirements
[x] Quick to build
[x] Essentially free
[x] don't expose my phone number or api creds

## TODO (these probably wont get done)
[] use async/await syntax
[] use typescript
[] add some other kinds of useful notifications
